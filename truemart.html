                <span>With a design challenge that required to solve a real, clearly identified need in users’ everyday lives, the most shared problem was grocery shopping. After brainstorming and user interviews bloomed TrueMart, the application that helps you find your nearest, best quality grocery market. <br/><br/>This idea came from shared experiences prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, and was only made more difficult at the height of it. Finding food and products was difficult to find and for those wanting better quality of it would be a luxury. </span>
